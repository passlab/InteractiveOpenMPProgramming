    "# Advanced Topics and Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will explore advanced topics and best practices for GPU offloading with OpenMP. We will discuss the Unified Shared Memory (USM) model, interoperability with other GPU programming models like CUDA, debugging and error handling techniques, and performance portability considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unified Shared Memory (USM) model\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenMP 5.0 introduced the Unified Shared Memory (USM) model, which provides a unified view of memory across the host and device. USM simplifies memory management and enables more flexible data sharing between the host and device.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three types of USM allocations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Device allocations: Memory is allocated on the device and can only be accessed by the device.\n",
    "- Host allocations: Memory is allocated on the host and can be accessed by both the host and device.\n",
    "- Shared allocations: Memory is accessible by both the host and device, with the allocation being managed by the runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```c\n",
    "int* shared_data = omp_target_alloc_shared(n * sizeof(int), omp_get_default_device());\n",
    "\n",
    "#pragma omp target teams distribute parallel for\n",
    "for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n",
    "  shared_data[i] = i;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// Access shared_data on the host\n",
    "for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n",
    "  printf(\"%d \", shared_data[i]);\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "omp_target_free(shared_data, omp_get_default_device());\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `omp_target_alloc_shared` is used to allocate shared memory that is accessible by both the host and device. The device modifies the shared data, and the host can directly access it without explicit data transfers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interoperability with CUDA and other GPU programming models\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenMP can interoperate with other GPU programming models, such as CUDA, to leverage existing code or libraries. OpenMP provides mechanisms to integrate with CUDA code and perform seamless data sharing between OpenMP and CUDA.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```c\n",
    "// CUDA kernel\n",
    "__global__ void cuda_kernel(int* data, int n) {\n",
    "  int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;\n",
    "  if (idx < n) {\n",
    "    data[idx] *= 2;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// OpenMP target region\n",
    "#pragma omp target data map(tofrom: data[0:n])\n",
    "{\n",
    "  // Launch CUDA kernel\n",
    "  cuda_kernel<<<(n + 255) / 256, 256>>>(data, n);\n",
    "\n",
    "  // OpenMP parallel loop\n",
    "  #pragma omp target teams distribute parallel for\n",
    "  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n",
    "    data[i] += 1;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, a CUDA kernel is launched within an OpenMP target data region. The data is mapped between the host and device using the `map` clause, allowing both the CUDA kernel and the OpenMP parallel loop to operate on the same data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Debugging and error handling for GPU offloading\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging GPU-offloaded code can be challenging due to the separate execution on the device. OpenMP provides several techniques and best practices for debugging and error handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the `omp_set_default_device` function to specify the device for debugging purposes.\n",
    "- Employ conditional compilation or runtime checks to execute device code on the host for easier debugging.\n",
    "- Utilize device-specific debugging tools, such as NVIDIA CUDA-GDB or AMD ROCm GDB, to debug GPU code directly.\n",
    "- Implement robust error handling mechanisms to detect and handle errors that may occur during GPU execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```c\n",
    "#pragma omp target teams distribute parallel for\n",
    "for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\n",
    "  if (data[i] < 0) {\n",
    "    #pragma omp critical\n",
    "    {\n",
    "      fprintf(stderr, \"Error: Negative value encountered at index %d\\n\", i);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    #pragma omp cancel teams\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  // ...\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, error handling is implemented within the target region. If a negative value is encountered in the `data` array, an error message is printed, and the `cancel` directive is used to abort the execution of the target region.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.4 Performance portability considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance portability is an important aspect of GPU offloading, as it ensures that the code can run efficiently across different GPU architectures and systems. Some considerations for performance portability include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use OpenMP directives and clauses that are supported across different compilers and platforms.\n",
    "- Avoid device-specific optimizations that may hinder portability.\n",
    "- Employ runtime checks and device-specific code paths to adapt to different GPU capabilities.\n",
    "- Utilize OpenMP's device-specific functions and environment variables to query device information and adjust execution parameters accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```c\n",
    "#ifdef _OPENMP\n",
    "  int max_teams = omp_get_max_teams();\n",
    "  int max_threads = omp_get_max_threads();\n",
    "#else\n",
    "  int max_teams = 64;\n",
    "  int max_threads = 128;\n",
    "#endif\n",
    "\n",
    "#pragma omp target teams num_teams(max_teams) thread_limit(max_threads)\n",
    "{\n",
    "  // ...\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the number of teams and threads per team is adjusted based on the device capabilities using OpenMP's runtime functions. This allows the code to adapt to different devices and achieve better performance portability.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging advanced features like USM, interoperability with other GPU programming models, debugging techniques, and considering performance portability, programmers can write efficient and portable GPU-offloaded code using OpenMP."
