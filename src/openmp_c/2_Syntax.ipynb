    "# Creating a Parallel Program with OpenMP\n",
    "In this section, we will introduce the syntax of OpenMP, how to compile OpenMP programs, and give the readers an overall picture of OpenMP programs through two simple examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to compile OpenMP programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this book, all our examples are compiled using LLVM/Clang on Ubuntu 20.04. LLVM/Clang has the advantages of fast compilation speed, less memory usage, and modular design.\n",
    "To execute OpenMP code, you need to add -fopenmp when compiling. The full command to compile is \n",
    "```js\n",
    "clang -fopenmp filename.c -o filename.o\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also worth mentioning that when writing OpenMP programs, you need to include the <omp.h> header file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## OpenMP Directives and Syntax\n",
    "A series of directives and clauses in OpenMP identify code blocks as parallel regions. Programmers only need to insert these directives into the code, so OpenMP is defined as a kind of directive_based language.\n",
    "In C/C++, the directive is based on the #pragma omp construct. In Fortran, instructions begin with ! $omp. This is a regular language pragma (in C/C++) or a regular comment (in Fortran) for Compilers. So special option is need when the compiler is required to generate OpenMP code. Otherwise the compiler won't recognize it and simply ignore it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic format of OpenMP directive in C/C++ is as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "#pragma omp directive-name [clause[ [,] clause]...]\n",
    "```\n",
    "and in fortran：\n",
    "```\n",
    "!$omp directive-name [clause[ [,] clause]...]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where '[]' means optional. A directive acts on the statement immediately following it or a block of statements enclosed by '{}'. Common diretcives are parallel, for, sections, single, atomic, barrier, simd, target, etc.\n",
    "Clause is equivalent to the modification of directive, which can be used to further specify the behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some OpenMP directives specify a paired end directive, where the directive-name of the paired end directives is:\n",
    "\n",
    "• If directive-name starts with begin, the end-directive-name replaces begin with end\n",
    "\n",
    "• otherwise it is end directive-name unless otherwise specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a simple OpenMP Program\n",
    "This simple OpenMP program execute in parallel using multiple threads, and each thread outputs a 'Hello World'."
