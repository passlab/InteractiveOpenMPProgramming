    "# Multicore and Multi-CPU Machines\n",
    "As previously mentioned in this book we will be discussing the applications of OpenMP on MultiCore and MultiCPU machines. Before we understand the need for OpenMP we first must understand the need for MultiCore and MutliCPU machines. As most of you may recall Moores's Law states CPUs double in frequency every two years. Which was possible by increasing the transistor density. As time has gone on this has proven to be more difficult because with more transistors more heat is produced. As this problem became more apparent Computer Architects turned to another solution, a cheaper yet effective solution. Which was the implementation of multiple cores within a CPU. IBM was the first to release a Multi-core CPU back in 2001. Intel’s attempt to release processors of this caliber came in 2002 with the Intel Pentium 4. This processor didn’t implement parallel computing more or less just hyperthreading. This allowed it to switch between programs really fast so it gave the appearance of doing multiple processes at once. Since then multicore machines have taken over the consumer and corprate market, with most computers and even phone coming standard with mutliple cores. "
