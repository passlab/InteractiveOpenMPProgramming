    "As we have already introduced in chapter 1, clauses are used to specify additional information with the directive.\n",
    "Ten clauses can be used with the **parallel** directive, listing as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if([ parallel :] scalar-expression)\n",
    "num_threads(integer-expression)\n",
    "default(data-sharing-attribute)\n",

    "proc_bind(affinity-policy)\n",
    "allocate([allocator :] list)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **if** Clause\n",
    "The **if** clause is used to achieve conditional parallelism. It can be used with many directives, such as **parallel** directive, **task** directive, **simd** directive, etc. Its effect depends on the construct to which it is applied. The syntax is as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "if([ directive-name-modifier :] scalar-expression)\n",
    "```\n",
    "or\n",
    "```\n",
    "if([ directive-name-modifier :] scalar-logical-expression)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The *directive-name-modifier* is optional and is very useful in combined constructs, which we will cover in the later chapters. When the **if** claue is used with the **parallel** directive, only *parallel* can be used as the *directive-name-modifier*. Its semantics are that the parallel region is active when the *scaler-expression* or *scalar-logical-expression* is true, otherwise the parallel region that follows will be inactive. At most one **if** clause can be used in each parallel construct.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **num_threads** Clause\n",
    "The syntax for **num_threads** is as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "num_threads(integer-expression)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We used the **num_threads** clause in the previous example to indicate the number of threads used to execute parallel regions. \n",
    "The number of threads in the parallel region is determined by *integer-expression*. At most one **num_threads** clause can be used in each parallel construct. Because the number of threads used must be uniquely determined when entering the parallel regionï¼Œ whether explicitly specified by the programmer using **num_threads** clause or implicitly specified by the compiler. Of course, the *scaler-expression* must be an integer greater than zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data-Sharing Attribute Clauses\n",
    "Data-sharing attribute clauses are used to control the data-sharing attributes of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four data-sharing attribute clauses that can be used with the **parallel** directive, namely **default** clause, **private** clause, **firstprivate** clause and **shared** clause. The **lastprivate** clause and **linear** clause are two other data-sharing attribute clauses. They cannot be used with **parallel** directives, so we will skip them for now and describe them in detail in later chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first introduce the **private** clause, **firstprivate** clause and **shared** clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **private** Clause\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax of the **private** clause is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "private(list)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, a set of implicit tasks, equal in number to the number of threads in the team, is generated by the master thread when it encountering the parallel region.\n",
    "The **private** caluse is used to declare private variable(s) in the *list* for a task or a SIMD lane. A private variable has a different address in the execution context of every thread. These variables are private to threads, and threads cannot access private variables owned by other threads. Programmers can use the **private** clause as many times as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **firstprivate** Clause\n",
    "The **firstprivate** clause is very similar to the **private** clause. They both indicate that the variables in the *list* are private to the thread. Its syntax is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "firstprivate(list)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But unlike the **private** clause, the variables in the *list* are initialized to the initial value that the original item had in the serial area. Like **private** clause, the **firstprivate** clause can be used multiple times in the parallel construct.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **shared** Clause\n",
    "\n",
    "The **shared** clause is used to declare that one or more items in the *list* can be shared by tasks or SIMD lane. Its syntax is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "shared(list)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Shared variables have the same address in the execution context of every thread. In a parallel region, all threads or SIMD lanes can access these variables. The **shared** clause can also be used multiple times within a parallel struct.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **default** Clause\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax of **default** clauseï¼š\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "default(data-sharing-attribute)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The **default** clause is used to define the default data-sharing attribute of variables in a parallel construct(it also can be used in a teams, or task-generating construct). \n",
    "The *data-sharing-attribute* is one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "> private <br />\n",
    "> firstprivate <br />\n",
    "> shared <br />\n",
    "> none\n",
    "\n",
    "When the data-sharing attribute of a variable is not specified, the data-sharing attribute of this variable will be set to the attribute specified in the **default** clause. If we have a variable *a* and the *data-sharing-attribute* in the **default** clause is *shared*, then we can understand it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if(variable a is not assigned data-sharing attribute && we have clause default(shared)) {\n",
    "    equals to : we have clause shared(a)\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A special note for the **default(none)** clause:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The **default(none)** clause means that we do not define any data-sharing attribute for variables. The compiler does not implicitly define this for us, therefore, the variables need to be listed explicitly in other data-sharing attribute clauses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the above three clauses, **default** clause can only appear once in a directive. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Implicit Scoping Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "You may ask, if the **default** clause is not used, what data-sharing attribute is the variable that is not explicitly listed in other clauses? In fact, OpenMP defines a set of implicit scope rules. It determines the data-sharing attribute of a variable based on the characteristics of the variable being accessed. For example, for threads in a group, a variable is scoped to *shared* if using this variable in the parallel region does not result in a data race condition. A variable is scoped to *private* if, in each thread executing the parallel region, the variable is always written before being read by the same thread. The detailed rules can be found in the OpenMP specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although OpenMP proposes as detailed and explicit rules as possible for implicit scoping, there is still a high possibility of unpredictable errors. Therefore, it is undoubtedly the best choice for programmers to use clauses to explicitly specify the data-sharing attributes of variables. This is an important aspect of OpenMP program optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **copyin** Clause\n",
    "\n",
    "The **copyin** clause is the one of two data copying clauses that can be used on the **parallel** construct or combined parallel worksharing constructs. The other one is the **copyprivate** clause which is only allowed on the **single** construct.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before introducing these two clauses, we need to introduce a new data-sharing attribute, named *threadprivate*. The difference between private variables and thread private variables can be briefly described as follows:\n",
    "- Private variables are local to a region and are placed on the stack most of the time. The lifetime of a private variable is the duration defined by the data scope clause. Every thread, including the main thread, makes a private copy of the original variable, and the new variable is no longer storage-associated to the original.\n",
    "- Threadprivate variables are persist across regions, most likely to be placed in the heap or in thread-local storage, which can be seen as being stored in a local memory local to the thread. The main thread uses the original variable and other threads make private copies of the original variable. The host variable is still store-associated with the original variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax of the **copyin** Clause is as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "copyin(list)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It can copy the value of the main thread's threadprivate variable into the threadprivate variable of every other member in the team that is executing the parallel region. And it can be used multiple times within a parallel struct.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **reduction** Clause\n",
    "\n",
    "The **reduction** clause belongs to the *reduction scoping clauses* and the *reduction participating clauses*. The *reduction scoping clauses* define the region of a reduction computed by a task or a SIMD lane. The *reduction participating clauses* are used to define a task or SIMD channel as a reduction participant. The **reduction** clause is specifically designed for reduction operations, and it allows the user to specify one or more thread-private variables that accept reduction operation at the end of the parallel region.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax of the **reduction** clause is as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "reduction([ reduction-modifier,]reduction-identifier : list)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The *reduction-modifier* is optional and is used to describe the characteristics of the reduction operation. It can be one of the following:\n",
    "> inscan <br />\n",
    "> task <br />\n",
    "> default\n",
    "\n",
    "When the *reduction-modifier* is *inscan*, the list items on each iteration of a loop nest will be updated with scan computation.\n",
    "When *inscan* is used, one list item must be as a list item in an **inclusive** or **exclusive** clause on a **scan** directive enclosed by the construct. \n",
    "It separates the items in the list from the reduction operations, and decides whether the storage statement includes or excludes the scan input of the present iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the *reduction-modifier* is *task*, an indeterminate number of additional private copies will be generated to support task reduction, and these reduction-related copies will be initialized before they are accessed by the tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "When *reduction-modifier* is *default* or when no *reduction-modifier* is specified, the behavior will be relative to the construct in which the reduction is located. For **parallel**, **scope** and **simd** construcrs, one or more private copies of each list item are created for each implicit task (for **parallel** and **scope**) or SIMD lane (for **simd**), as if the **private** clause had been used. Some other rules for other constructs can be found in the OpenMP specification and we will not go into details here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *reduction-identifier* is used to specify the reduction operator.\n",
    "According to the OpenMP specification, the *reduction-identifier* has the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For C languageï¼Œa *reduction-identifier* is either an identifier or one of the following operators: +, - (deprecated), \\*, &, |, ^, && and ||. \n",
    "- For C++, a *reduction-identifier* is either an id-expression or one of the following operators: +, - (deprecated), \\*, &, |, ^, && and ||. \n",
    "- For Fortranï¼Œ a *reduction-identifier* is either a base language identifier, or a user-defined operator, or one of the following operators: +, - (deprecated), \\*, .and., .or., .eqv., .neqv., or one of the following intrinsic procedure names: max, min, iand, ior, ieor.\n",

    "\n",
    "The **proc_bind** clause is used to specify a mapping of OpenMP threads to places within the current place partition for implicit tasks of the encountering threads. At most one proc_bind clause can appear on the directive. Its syntax is as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "proc_bind(affinity-policy) \n",
    "```\n",
    "and the *affinity-policy* is one of the followingï¼š\n",
    "> primary <br />\n",
    "> master \\[deprecated\\] <br />\n",
    "> close  <br />\n",
    "> spread\n",
    "\n",
    "When *affinity-policy* is specified as *primary*, it means that the execution environment assigns each thread in the group to the same location as the primary thread.\n",
    "The *master* affinity policy has been deprecated, it has identical semantics as *prime*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *close* thread affinity policy instructs the execution environment to assign threads in the group closer to the parent thread's location. When the number of threads **P** in the group is less than the number of locations **P** in the partition where the parent thread is located, each thread will be assigned one place, otherwise, **T/P** threads will be assigned to one place. When **P** does not divide **T** equally, the exact number of threads at a particular place is implementation-defined. The principle of allocation is that the thread number with the thread with the smallest thread number is executed at the position of the parent thread, and then the threads are allocated backward in the order of increasing thread number, and wrap-around with respect to the place partition of the primary thread. \n",
    "\n",
    "The *spread* thread affinity policy is to create **P** sub-partitions in the parent partition and distribute the threads in these sub-partitions, thus achieving a sparse distribution.\n",
    "When the number of threads is equal to or less than **P**, the number of sub-partitions is equal to the number of threads **T**, and the threads are distributed in the first position of each partition in order of thread number from small to large. Conversely, when the number of threads is greater than **P**, **T/P** threads with consecutive thread numbers are allocated to each sub-partition. \n",
    "Sorted by thread number, the first **T/P** threads are allocated in the subpartition that contains the place of the parent thread. The remaining thread groups are allocated backward in turn, with a wrap-around with respect to the original place partition of the primary thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **allocate** Clause\n",
    "The **allocate** clause is used to specify the memory allocator used to obtain storage of the private variables. When it is used with **parallel** construct, the syntax is shown as following:\n",
